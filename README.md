## Project Requirements
- Summarize requirements
## Current Status

## Contents
- ### `research` directory
    - `abstractionAnalysis` directory: Contains abstraction analysis files
    - `programAnalysis` directory: Not needed?
- ### `trunk` directory
    - Contains POET library files
## Installation
### Prerequisities
- POET installed on your local machine (add link to POET repo)
### Steps
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
  * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:yimjay/abstraction-analysis.git`
  * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/yimjay/abstraction-analysis.git`
- Once downloaded, change your present working directory on your local machine to the newly downloaded directory's abstractionAnalysis directory with `cd abstraction-analysis/research/abstractionAnalysis` before running the project

## Usage
- To run a SinglyLinkedList comparison against a Stack abstraction, type `make stack`
- To run a SinglyLinkedList comparison against a Queue abstraction, type `make queue`
