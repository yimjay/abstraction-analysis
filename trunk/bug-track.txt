1. When I compiled POET use "make". I found there's A Macro POET_LIB_DIR which is assigned by source code's lib rather than the destination's lib.
$ make
g++ ……   -DPOET_LIB_DIR=\"/home/doer/Downloads/poet-1.03.07/lib\"   -DPOET_DEST_DIR=\"//opt/poet-1.03.07/lib/\"   ……

So, if I don't delete source code after I install poet, the pcg will still treate source code's lib directory as the lib directory.

Can we  delete POET_LIB_DIR or push POET_DEST_DIR/lib first???
